# CV-Assignment_3

This repository contains four google colab notebook files which is a part of Assignment 3. Keras open source python library is used in these projects. To get the pretrained weights obtained from these goto following links.
1. For model that is trained on constant learning rate without data augmetation click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11NJzaEh_RGWqth-SsN51lG4GZuX3gBED/view?usp=sharing)
2. For model that is trained on constant learning rate with data augmetation click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oa_st4H0gPGMbFA2Mz2TI-5WANxWAis3/view?usp=sharing)
3. For model that is trained on time based decaing learning rate with data augmetation click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WdBdZVzA2kPQ8yQ45G6J5PDVHiHyA04O/view?usp=sharing)
4. For model that is trained on Adam Optimizer with data augmetation click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jUZnXDfAe9gvbbnujXbLNnPg35EjCMqL/view?usp=sharing)

To use above weights, import VGG16 model in jupiter notebook and load those model using keras.model.load_weights(file.h5).
